					<p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">AWCom Media Suite is an easy way to access some of the Internet's best websites from the comfort of your virtual home in ActiveWorlds. It can be used on any almost any object, in any world, regardless of the world's object path, although we provide a downloadable object group to load into the 3D environment.</p>

					<p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 70px;" class="sfmedium">Prerequisites</p>
					<p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">You may need to modify your Web settings to use AWCom Media Suite. New browser installations come with these settings already adjusted, so if you have recently downloaded ActiveWorlds, you can skip this section.</p>
					<p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">To modify these settings, switch to the ActiveWorlds browser, then navigate to [Options] <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> [Settings] <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> [Web tab]. Under the [Embedded web + WebCap (IE Controls)] group, ensure the following options are set.</p>
					
					<p style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #CCC; background: #EEE;">[Disable web action commands] must be <b class="sfbold"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-square-o"></i> unchecked</b>.</p>

					<p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">The AWCom Media Suite currently includes Smart TV, Smart Ads, Radio, Play, and access to the MyAW closed beta.</p>
					<p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 20px;">To use the AWCom Media Suite, download the file below, unzip it, and place the included <b>awc_ms.awg</b> file in your Presets folder. You can then place it in ActiveWorlds by clicking "Load Object Group" while an object is selected.</p>
